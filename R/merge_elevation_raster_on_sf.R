#' Compute slope and aspect from elevation and their mean by polygon
#'
#' This function overlays the user-specified polygon feature class with slope and aspect raster to
#' add mean aspect, mean slope and slope modifiers to the polygon attributes
#'
#' @param elev_raster SpatRaster object that represent the elevation
#' @param vri_bem sf object containing VRI-BEM
#' @param elevation_threshold numeric elevation threshold used to create above elevation indicator (`ABOVE_ELEV_THOLD`)
#' @param terrain_raster SpatRaster that contains slope and aspect computed in radiants
#' @return VRI-BEM augmented of the following variables : MEAN_ASP, MEAN_SLOPE, SLOPE_MOD and ABOVE_ELEV_THOLD.
#' @details
#' Aspect and slope are calculated by extracting the information from the elevation raster.
#'
#' Based on whether the the elevation is above the selected threshold then ABOLVE_ELEV_THOLD is created with either "Y" or "N".
#'
#' The SLOPE_MOD is then defined using the following logic:
#'  * k - _cool aspect_:  if aspect is 285-359 or 0-134 AND slope is 25%-100% (except in CWH and MH zones, it's 35%-100%)
#'  * q - _very steep cool aspect_:  if aspect is 285-359 or 0-134 AND slope > 100%
#'  * w - _warm aspect_:  if aspect is 135-284 AND slope is 25%-100% (except in CWH and MH zones, it's 35%-100%)
#'  * z - _very steep warm aspect_: if aspect is 135-284 AND slope > 100%
